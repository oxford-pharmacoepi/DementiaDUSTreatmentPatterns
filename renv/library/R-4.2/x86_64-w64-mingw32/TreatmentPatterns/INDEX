addPathwaySettings      Add set of pathway settings.
cohortCharacterization
                        Optional, only for OMOP-CDM data: Perform
                        baseline characterization of study/target
                        population.
constructPathways       Construct treatment pathways.
createCharacterizationSettings
                        Create characterization settings (optional,
                        only for OMOP-CDM data ).
createCohortSettings    Create cohort settings.
createCohorts           Create target/event cohorts of interest.
createDataSettings      Create data settings.
createPathwaySettings   Create pathway settings.
createSaveSettings      Create save settings.
createSunburstPlot      Function to create sunburst plot from CSV file.
executeTreatmentPatterns
                        This is the main function which runs all parts
                        of the treatment pathways analysis. The
                        following tasks are performed sequentially: 1)
                        Create target/event cohorts of interest, 2)
                        Optional, only for OMOP-CDM data: Perform
                        baseline characterization of study/target
                        population, 3) Construct treatment pathways, 4)
                        Generate output (sunburst plots, Sankey
                        diagrams and more), 5) Launch shiny application
                        to visualize the results.
generateOutput          Generate output (sunburst plots, Sankey
                        diagrams and more).
launchResultsExplorer   Processes the zipped result folder(s) and
                        launch the shiny application.
